RUNNING

To run the program first you must run the make file with the command 'make'. This will compile
compile.c and run the resulting executable which creates the maine .js file. Now that you have the
.js file you can open index.html and view the resulting Social Browser. You can also create your own
.html file using the example as a reference or a base for the new one.
